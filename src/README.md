Design and implement a hierarchy of a Shape concept

1. The hierarchy has its main Shape iterface (or abstract class - it is your decision)
2. There are Quadrilateral, Ellipse, Triangle as classes which extend/implement Shape class
    - define methods which use fomulas and objects internal state (properties) to calculate area and perimeter of a shape - inheritance/polymorphism
    - define properies which are required for area and perimeter calculations
3. Create Parallelogram, Rhombus, Rectangle and Square classes and place them in the right order in the classes hierarchy - inheritance and IS-A relationship
